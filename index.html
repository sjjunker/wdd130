                <p>My name is Sandi, and I currently live in Alabama.
                    I am a mother of three, and I'm studying software development.
                    I enjoy fishing, cooking, running, gardening, and many other hobbies. Some of my favorite foods include ice
                    cream, cheesy garlic bread sticks, poke bowls, and sweet chili doritos. I've served in the military as a
                    intelligence analyst. <br> <br>Currently, I am growing a winter garden with cabbages, radishes, broccoli,
                    peas, lettuce, spinach, and other cold-tolernat vegetables. Unfortuantely, I don't have the greenest thumb.
                    The peas are growing great, but my radishes aren't developing any roots. My spinach, lettuce, and beets are
                    still tiny after over a month of growing. And, my broccoli, kale, and cabbage never came up. Once the
                    weather gets warmer, I look forward to trying to grow tomatos, peppers, onions, pumpkins, and many other
                    delicious plants. Hopefully, my thumb will get greener as time goes on.

                <p>Founded in 1702, Alabama is a beautiful state home to roughly 5 million people. Located in the Bible Belt of
                    the southeastern United States, Alabama can boast that it is the first state to declare Christmas a holiday,
                    and is also where Martin Luther King, Jr. began his religious career. Alabama is also known for its rocket
                    building facility in Huntsville, which produced rockets that NASA used to send people to the moon and to
                    launch the first sucessful US satellite.</p>
