            <p>Founded in 1702, Alabama is a beautiful state home to roughly 5 million people. Located in the Bible Belt of the southeastern United States, Alabama can boast that it is the first state to declare Christmas a holiday, and is also where Martin Luther King, Jr. began his religious career. Alabama is also known for its rocket building facility in Huntsville, which produced rockets that NASA used to send people to the moon and to launch the first sucessful US satellite.</p>
